# qr-filetransfer-cpp

Transfer files over Wi-Fi from your computer to a mobile device by scanning a QR code.

This repository is inspired by [Claudio d'Angelis's qr-filetransfer](https://github.com/claudiodangelis/qr-filetransfer).

## How does it work?

`qr-filetransfer_cpp` binds a web server to the address you choose on a random port and creates a handler for it. The default handler serves the content and exits the program when the transfer is complete.

The tool prints a QR code that encodes the text:

    http://{address}:{port}/{random_path}

Most QR apps can detect URLs in decoded text and act accordingly (i.e. open the decoded URL with the default browser), so when the QR code is scanned the content will begin downloading by the mobile browser.

## Usage

-   Download a single file from server:
    -   `qr-filetransfer /path/to/file.txt`

-   Upload into the current folder using a random port and a random path ( the ip address will be chosen interactively)
    -   `qr-filetransfer -r .`

-   Upload into the current folder using a random port and a random path ( the ip address will be chosen interactively)
    -   `qr-filetransfer -r -s qrcp .`

-   Upload into the current folder using the address http://host:8080/upload  ( the ip address will be chosen interactively)
    -   `qr-filetransfer -r -s upload -p 8080 .`

## How to build

The project is buildable with CMake from both linux and windows.
The project depends on:

- cpp-httplib (web server) https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib
- libqrencode (qr code generation) https://github.com/fukuchi/libqrencode
- fmt (string formatting) https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt
- taywee::args (command line arguments parsing) https://github.com/Taywee/args
- picohash (md5 hashing, **not packaged** ) https://github.com/kazuho/picohash forked into https://github.com/VincenzoLaSpesa/picohash

picohash has no package both in conan and vcpkg, so it's included as a subrepository, remember to **DO A RECURSIVE CHECKOUT**.

You can install the other dependencies in different ways, the suggested way is using Conan.

The project can be compiled both with Meson and CMake

### Meson + Conan2
the scripts `build_mason.ps1` and `build_mason.sh` can be used for downloading the dependencies and compile the project. The output will be in ./output

#### On Windows
Make sure that:
-   You have VisualStudio, or at least the compiler of visual studio installed
-   You have Meson installed
-   You have pkgconfiglite installed ( the easiest way is from choco)
-   You have Conan installed ( and configured)
-   You have CMake installed ( yes, it is needed anyway, Meson is just way easier to set up)

#### On Linux
Make sure that:
-   You have the compiler suite installed
-   You have Meson installed
-   You have Conan installed ( and configured)
-   You have CMake installed ( yes, it is needed anyway, Meson is just way easier to set up)

### What about cross compiling?
Either setup Conan (and Meson, if you use it) to match the building architecture, or use dockcross https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross

### But I'm lazy! give me the binary!
    TODO

## State of the project:

This is absolutely a work in progress.
It mostly works, but i use it for experimenting with building pipelines.

### Completed features
-   Serve a single file and close ( desktop to mobile)
-   Serve a single file and keep the server open ( desktop to mobile)
-   Upload a file ( from mobile to desktop)
-   Verbose option
-   Specify a custom port   
-   Interface names

### TODO 
-   Store/load settings

## Why?

From time to time i try to build something in C++ from scratch for experimenting with the newest features of the language, newer libraries, newer build systems.
I usually end up thinking that it is still a mess, but this time... ok, it's still a mess *but it was fun*, and cpp-httplib is cool.
